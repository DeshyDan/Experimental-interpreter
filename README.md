# Mandela Script

Welcome to **Mandela Script** – a fun and experimental interpreted programming language inspired by the diverse languages of South Africa! Named in honor of **Nelson Mandela**, this language is designed to incorporate elements from multiple South African languages while providing a unique coding experience.

## 🌍 What is Mandela Script?

Mandela Script is my own custom programming language, featuring syntax inspired by **Xitsongs, Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, and other South African languages**. Instead of traditional keywords, the language uses localized terms – for example, `awe` is used for printing to the console.

## ✨ Features

- **Custom Interpreter** – Written from scratch to process and execute Mandela Script code.
- **South African Language Elements** – Keywords and syntax influenced by multiple South African languages.
- **Fun and Expressive** – A unique way to experiment with programming through a cultural lens.
- **Dynamic Typing** – No need to declare types; just code and go!

## 🚀 Example Code

Here’s a simple Mandela Script program that prints a message to the console:

```mandela
# Hello, World! in Mandela Script
awe "Molo, Umhlaba!"  # Prints Hello, World! in Xhosa
```

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   Coming soon
   ```
2. Run the interpreter:
   ```sh
   Coming soon
   ```

## 🛠️ Planned Features

- **More built-in functions** for string manipulation, math operations, and file handling.
- **Conditionals and loops** to support logic-based programming.
- **Better error handling** with meaningful messages.
- **Support for more South African languages** in syntax.
